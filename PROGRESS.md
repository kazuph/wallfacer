## Task: 5bd6c11f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 19:56:02  
**Branch**: task/5bd6c11f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> there is a bug that task card is moved to waiting although the container is still up and running and executing

**Result**:
The repository at `/workspace/wallfacer` is a git worktree whose parent `.git` directory is at `/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer` — a host macOS path that isn't accessible from inside this container. Git operations fail because the worktree's backing store doesn't exist in this environment.

The changes I made are:

**`runner.go`**
- Added `Type string \`json:"type"\`` field to `claudeOutput` to capture the event type from Claude Code's stream-json format.
- Extracted a new `parseClaudeOutput(raw string) (claudeOutput, bool, error)` function containing all NDJSON parsing logic, making it independently testable.
- Fixed the NDJSON scanning loop to scan backward and **prefer the `type:"result"` event** rather than simply taking the last parseable JSON line.
- Added propagation of `runErr` when the container produced no result event (only intermediate events) — the task is now marked **failed** instead of incorrectly transitioning to **waiting**.

## Task: 5e07080d

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:45:00  
**Branch**: task/5e07080d  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
The `/workspace/wallfacer` directory uses a **git worktree** that references a path on the original machine (`/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer`), which is not accessible in this environment. Git commands fail because the worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist here.

The change I made (`ui/index.html:29` — logo color and font-weight) is saved to disk, but I'm unable to commit it since the git repository's backing store is on a different filesystem path that isn't mounted here.

You'll need to run the commit from your local machine:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/wallfacer/worktree
git add ui/index.html
git commit -m "style: update Wallfacer logo text to bold blue (rgb(0, 85, 170))"
```

## Task: bba2460f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:51:48  
**Branch**: task/bba2460f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
There are no git repositories under `/workspace/wallfacer` — none of the directories (`ui`, `docs`, `sandbox`) or the root itself contain a `.git` folder, so there's nothing to commit.

To commit the change to `index.html`, you would need to initialize a git repo first. Would you like me to run `git init` in `/workspace/wallfacer` (or one of its subdirectories) and create the initial commit?

## Bug Fix: Commit Pipeline Broken with Git Worktrees

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Files changed**: `runner.go`, `commit_test.go` (new)

### Root Cause

The commit pipeline Phase 1 ran a **container** to ask Claude to stage and
commit changes. However, the container mounted the git **worktree** directory,
whose `.git` file contains an absolute host path like:

```
gitdir: /Users/changkun/.../wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer
```

This path does not exist inside the container. All git commands (add, commit,
status, etc.) fail silently, so Phase 1 creates no commits. Phase 2
(rebase+merge) then finds no commits ahead of the default branch and skips.
Result: **nothing gets committed, worktrees are cleaned up, changes are lost.**

Evidence from prior task results (see entries above): Claude's own output said
"the git worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist in this environment."

### Fix

Replaced Phase 1 (container-based commit via Claude) with **host-side git
operations** (`git add -A` + `git commit`) in `runner.hostStageAndCommit()`.
The host has full access to the worktree's git metadata, so the commit succeeds.

The full pipeline is now:
1. **Phase 1**: Host-side `git add -A && git commit` in each worktree
2. **Phase 2**: Host-side rebase onto default branch + ff-merge (unchanged)
3. **Phase 3**: PROGRESS.md update (unchanged)
4. **Phase 4**: Worktree cleanup (unchanged)

### Prevention

- Added 9 tests in `commit_test.go` covering the full pipeline:
  - `TestWorktreeSetup` — worktree creation
  - `TestWorktreeGitFilePointsToHost` — documents the root cause
  - `TestHostStageAndCommit` / `TestHostStageAndCommitNoChanges` — new method
  - `TestCommitPipelineBasic` — full pipeline
  - `TestCommitPipelineDivergedBranch` — rebase when main has advanced
  - `TestCommitPipelineNoChanges` — no-op when nothing changed
  - `TestCompleteTaskE2E` — exact waiting→done flow
  - `TestCommitOnTopOfLatestMain` — commits land on latest main

### Rule: Never run git inside containers on worktree mounts

Git worktrees use a `.git` **file** (not directory) that references the parent
repo's `.git/worktrees/` by absolute host path. Containers cannot resolve
these paths. All git operations on worktree data must happen on the **host**.

## Task: 08bfbaaa

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:17:58  
**Branch**: task/08bfbaaa  
**Commit**: `618f260c8999baf059ebd6fa03b2446879667177`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
Done. The "Wallfacer" logo text is now styled with `color: rgb(0, 85, 170)` and `font-weight: 700` (bold) at `index.html:29`.

## Task: 4748b65e

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:36:30  
**Branch**: task/4748b65e  
**Commit**: `91d41ab58475cefbbfbdbcfa19fd926d2e47bf7f`

**Prompt**:
> Update the current kanban UI color style to match claude's color style.
> Use https://claude.com and https://www.anthropic.com/ as examples

**Result**:
I can't see any active git diff or repository context. Could you share the diff you're referring to? It would help to know:

- Is this a diff from a PR, a git commit, or another tool?
- Which file were you expecting changes in (not `commit_test.go`)?

If you paste the diff here I can pinpoint exactly why `commit_test.go` appears in it.

## Task: 881e4374

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:35:50  
**Branch**: task/881e4374  
**Commit**: `b703c97ffb732eb166ad073b22ad2e7a8565c6eb`

**Prompt**:
> the live log pretty rendering seems odd. Example:
> 
> ⏺ Read(/workspace/wallfacer/runner.go)
> ⎿
>    380→
>    381→	// Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
>    382→	r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
> 
> why the code there has this strange "→" symbol? this make the reading a little harder. consider to fix this

**Result**:
This regex `^(\s*\d+)→\t?` matches the line-number prefix (optional spaces + digits + arrow + optional tab) and replaces it with the number followed by two spaces. So:

- `   380→\t// comment` becomes `   380  // comment`
- `   381→` (empty line) becomes `   381  `

The output will look like:
```
   380  
   381  // Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
   382  r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
```

## Task: d33a8c2f

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:04:48  
**Branch**: task/d33a8c2f  
**Commit**: `80ea1c7b1252804a9ad34c63a45c605d7239e162`

**Prompt**:
> add project/workspace level CLAUDE.md that is initiated from the default CLAUDE.md defined in wallfacer. in the top right config center, allow manual editing to workspace level CLAUDE.md and allow re-init it by looking into individual repo folder's CLAUDE.md (if exists). The workspace level CLAUDE.md should be initialized in ~/.wallfacer/instructions folder. Allowing it to be used per unique combination of set of repo folders. E.g. Repo A and B is using wallfacer, then their workspace CLAUDE.md should be tight when both A and B are in the workspace. If not, e.g. only A, then it should be a different CLAUDE.md

**Result**:
All clean. Here's a summary of what was verified and updated in this pass:

**Code verified still clean after upstream modifications:**
- `runner.go` gained `KillContainer`, `SyncWorktrees`, `failSync`, and an enhanced `Run` with panic-recovery guard — the `instructionsPath` mount slot integrates cleanly alongside those additions.
- `handler.go` gained `CancelTask` and `SyncTask` — the three new `GetInstructions`/`UpdateInstructions`/`ReinitInstructions` handlers were already placed after those.
- `main.go` gained `/cancel` and `/sync` routes, plus a `Cancelled` column in the board — the three `/api/instructions` routes are correctly registered.
- `styles.css` gained `badge-cancelled`, `col-header-cancelled`, terminal-style `.cc-*` classes, `diff-behind-warning`, and error-in-waiting card styles — no conflicts with the instructions modal.

**`CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect current state:**
- Added `instructions.go` to the key files list.
- Updated the API routes table with the 8...

## Task: e450d712

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:09:16  
**Branch**: task/e450d712  
**Commit**: `47081030c8ec1b2e26fb8e087f0c0c166b4fbe85`

**Prompt**:
> i don't like the browser based alert "localhost Says ..." Pls implement a proper modal for those cases.

**Result**:
Done. Here's what was changed:

- **`ui/index.html`** — added an alert modal (`#alert-modal`) above the detail modal. It uses `z-[60]` so it always sits on top, and has an error icon, a message paragraph, and an OK button.
- **`ui/js/utils.js`** — added `showAlert(message)` and `closeAlert()` helper functions.
- **`ui/js/tasks.js`**, **`ui/js/git.js`**, **`ui/js/instructions.js`** — all 14 `alert()` calls replaced with `showAlert()`.
- **`ui/js/events.js`** — Escape key now closes the alert modal first (if open) before the detail modal; clicking the backdrop also closes it.

## Task: d1482f72

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:15:24  
**Branch**: task/d1482f72  
**Commit**: `e2c7da306570b96f67b5c4b0da41644a20d30ecb`

**Prompt**:
> workspace level claude.md edit doesn't seem to work. I'd expect a modal shows up a text editor (with markdown support) to allow me update the CLAUDE.md
> 
> The re-init also doesn't seem to work. it poped up a alert then gone without any UI indication.

**Result**:
Both fixes are in place. Here's a summary of what was wrong and what changed:

**Bug 1 — Edit modal closes instantly**

Root cause: clicking "Edit" called `showInstructionsEditor()` which opened the modal, but the same click event then bubbled up to the `document` click listener. That listener saw the modal was open and the click target (the Edit button) wasn't inside `.modal-card`, so it immediately called `closeInstructionsEditor()`.

Fix: `showInstructionsEditor` now accepts `event` and calls `event.stopPropagation()` at the start. The HTML `onclick` was updated to pass `event`.

**Bug 2 — Re-init from settings panel has no visible result**

Root cause: `reinitInstructions()` called `_doReinit()` without the `updateEditor` flag. The success branch for that case was empty — only errors produced feedback (`showAlert`). The user saw the `confirm()` dialog (the "alert"), clicked OK, the API call happened silently, and nothing changed visually.

Fix: when `_doReinit` succeeds witho...

## Task: 36a0245a

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:23:32  
**Branch**: task/36a0245a  
**Commit**: `18b672218c44edd2e284e9e9861a30c13386a121`

**Prompt**:
> the UI top left Wallfacer text is too boring. any claude style like fonts and color to be revised?

**Result**:
The "Wallfacer" title now uses:

- **Instrument Serif italic** — a clean editorial serif with a refined, humanist quality similar to Claude's aesthetic
- **Warm gradient** — flows from `#d97757` → `#c4623f` → `#a84e2e`, matching the existing `--accent` color palette already in the CSS (so it harmonizes with both light and dark themes)
- Dropped the blue color, uppercase transform, and wide letter-spacing in favor of a more polished, editorial feel

## Task: e767d024

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:29:12  
**Branch**: task/e767d024  
**Commit**: `ea5c0ea83126421936f1878040216a6da9846b7a`

**Prompt**:
> the left-right side by side diff view for task card details in the waiting column seems broken. it shows only one top down and show diffs at the bottom. there is a wierd error yello box without anything inside which i expect to hide it if not error

**Result**:
Two fixes applied:

**Yellow box** (`styles.css`): The CSS `#modal-diff-behind { display: flex }` used ID-selector specificity (1,0,0), which beats Tailwind's `.hidden { display: none }` (0,1,0), so the yellow box always rendered even when empty. Fixed by splitting the rule — `display: flex` now only applies via `#modal-diff-behind:not(.hidden)`, while the base `#modal-diff-behind` rule only contains the visual/layout properties.

**Side-by-side layout** (`modal.js`): Rather than relying solely on the CSS selector `.modal-wide #modal-body { display: flex }` (which could lose to Tailwind CDN's later-injected stylesheet in the cascade), the layout is now also forced directly via `modalBody.style.display = 'flex'` inline style. Inline styles win over any CSS cascade. Cleared in both the `else` branch and `closeModal` so it doesn't bleed into non-wide modal opens.

**Prompt**:
> the web server always run in 8080 and cannot run multiple ones.
> 
> ACs:
> 
> - change to find available port to run the server
> - default to 8080

**Result**:
The changes are in `main.go:285-307`. Here's what was done:

- Added `"net"` to imports
- Replaced `http.ListenAndServe` with `net.Listen` + `http.Serve`
- On bind failure (port in use), logs a warning and retries with port `0` — letting the OS pick the next available port
- The actual bound port is used for both the log message and the browser URL, so the browser always opens to the correct address
- Default remains `:8080`; `-addr` flag and `ADDR` env var still work as before

## Task: 26c14307

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:40:20  
**Branch**: task/26c14307  
**Commit**: `e0b6c60d08c06810db845f87f52d963c630c12e4`

**Prompt**:
> modal-card is too narrow when viewing waiting card, it shows both task exec details and code diff. make it wider and optimzie for reading/inspection

**Result**:
The changes look correct. Here's a summary of what was changed:

**`ui/css/styles.css`:**
- Base `.modal-card`: widened from `672px` → `760px` (benefits all modals)
- `.modal-card.modal-wide`: expanded from `min(90vw, 1280px)` → `min(96vw, 1600px)` — roughly 25% more width on a typical monitor
- Panel split: left (task details/logs) is `flex: 2`, right (diff) is `flex: 3` — diff gets 60% of the space since code needs horizontal room
- Replaced `gap: 24px` with a `border-right` + `padding-right: 28px` + `margin-right: 28px` on the left panel for a proper visual divider
- `.modal-wide .logs-block`: logs expand to `560px` tall (was `384px`) so you can see more execution context without scrolling

**`ui/js/modal.js`:**
- Set inline `gap` to `'0'` to defer to the CSS-driven padding/border approach

## Task: 578edef8

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:44:30  
**Branch**: task/578edef8  
**Commit**: `bc56be23d825ecdf5e7c2266fc71952111f517a3`

**Prompt**:
> Currently all task cards contains only one prompt.
> 
> I want to have the system automatically create a task title which summarize the main goal of the task in 2-5 words. Make each task card show both task desc and title.
> 
> The title generation should be async, and optionally displayed only when it is available.
> 
> The title generation can be done via a sandbox exeuction by feeding task desc to sandbox and let it summarize quickly.

**Result**:
All done. Here's a summary of what was changed:

**`store.go`**
- Added `Title string` field (`json:"title,omitempty"`) to the `Task` struct
- Added `UpdateTaskTitle(ctx, id, title)` method that saves the title and notifies SSE subscribers

**`runner.go`**
- Added `GenerateTitle(taskID, prompt)` method that:
  - Spins up a minimal ephemeral container (`wallfacer-title-<uuid8>`) with a 60s timeout
  - Sends a prompt asking Claude for a 2-5 word title — no workspace or CLAUDE.md mounts needed
  - Parses the NDJSON output the same way as the main runner
  - Strips surrounding quotes and whitespace from the result
  - Calls `store.UpdateTaskTitle` which triggers an SSE push to update all connected browser tabs

**`handler.go`**
- In `CreateTask`, after persisting the task, fires `go h.runner.GenerateTitle(task.ID, task.Prompt)` — fully non-blocking

**`ui/js/render.js`**
- `updateCard` now renders `<div class="card-title">...</div>` above the prompt text, but only when `t.title` is pre...

## Task: 26c14307

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:54:02  
**Branch**: task/26c14307  
**Commit**: `6f5c7c78fd95ff0325536c9ad57c93a8b64aeb7d`

**Prompt**:
> modal-card is too narrow when viewing waiting card, it shows both task exec details and code diff. make it wider and optimzie for reading/inspection
> 
> the previous implementation doesn't seem to work and still have narrow view.

**Result**:
The root cause: `document.querySelector('.modal-card')` was matching the **instructions editor modal** (first in DOM order, line 67) instead of the task detail modal (line 162). So `modal-wide` was being added to the hidden instructions modal card — the CSS width expansion and panel layout rules never fired on the actual modal you were looking at.

The fix scopes both selectors to `#modal .modal-card`, which unambiguously targets the task detail modal card. Now when you open a waiting/failed task with worktrees, the card will expand to `min(96vw, 1600px)` with the 40/60 left/right panel split and the divider between them.

**Prompt**:

> 
> c) similarly, when running for B, both from a) and b) should not be visible.

**Result**:
Builds and vets clean. Here's what the migration does:

**On the next `wallfacer run ~/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer`:**

1. Computes the workspace fingerprint (e.g. `a3b7c91d2e4f5a6b`)
2. Calls `migrateUnscopedTaskData("~/.wallfacer/data", "~/.wallfacer/data/a3b7c91d2e4f5a6b")`
3. Scans `~/.wallfacer/data/` for entries with valid UUID names — those are the old task directories
4. Moves each one into the scoped subdirectory via `os.Rename` (atomic, same filesystem)
5. Logs how many were migrated
6. `NewStore` then loads from the now-populated scoped dir as normal

Subsequent starts find nothing left to migrate (UUIDs are gone from `baseDir`), so it's a no-op. The 16-char fingerprint subdirectories that future workspace combinations create are ignored since they don't parse as UUIDs.

**Result**:
The parsing logic already handles NDJSON by iterating lines in reverse and looking for the last valid JSON object — that's correct for `stream-json` output. The fix is complete.

The root cause: Claude Code's `--output-format=stream-json` requires `--verbose` when using `--print` mode. Adding `--verbose` satisfies that requirement.

**Result**:
Here's what was changed:

**`git.go`**
- Added `BehindCount int` to `WorkspaceGitStatus` — computed via `git rev-list --count HEAD..@{u}` (based on last fetch, no auto-fetch on poll)
- Added `GitSyncWorkspace` handler (`POST /api/git/sync`): runs `git fetch` then `git rebase @{u}`; on conflict aborts the rebase immediately and returns HTTP 409 with a message telling the user to resolve manually; other errors return HTTP 500

**`main.go`**

## Task: a53aaa87

**Date**: 2026-02-21 01:18:33  
**Branch**: task/a53aaa87  
**Commit**: `af4c2368b07f92ce3076efc63480e19bd56cae68`

**Prompt**:
> in the system setting, add a button to visit all task cards and check if a task has a title created. if not generate title for them.
> 
> the visit all should have a input selection to allow limit the amount of workload, e.g. default select 10 tasks for title generation

**Result**:
Everything is in place. Here's a summary of the changes made:

**Backend (`handler.go`)**
- Added `GenerateMissingTitles` handler (`POST /api/tasks/generate-titles?limit=N`)
  - Fetches all tasks (including archived), filters to those with empty `Title`
  - Respects a `limit` query param (default 10; `0` = unlimited/all)
  - Fires `runner.GenerateTitle()` goroutines for each selected task
  - Returns `{ queued: N, total_without_title: M }` as JSON
- Added `strconv` to imports

**Backend (`main.go`)**
- Registered the new route: `POST /api/tasks/generate-titles`

**Frontend (`ui/index.html`)**
- Added a "Task Titles" section in the settings panel with:
  - A `<select>` for the batch limit (5 / **10** / 25 / 50 / All)
  - A "Generate Missing" button
  - A status message area that shows how many were queued

**Frontend (`ui/js/tasks.js`)**
- Added `generateMissingTitles()` — reads the limit selector, calls the API, and displays the result (or an error) in the status area. The button is ...

## Task: 6b89458d

**Date**: 2026-02-21 01:19:11  
**Branch**: task/6b89458d  
**Commit**: `58139a85eeb5605743e95d8e1d7c737c50f87241`

**Prompt**:
> when canceling tasks inprogress, it seems moved to cancelled then immediately moved back to waiting. I'd expect to have it stay in the cancelled column

**Result**:
Builds cleanly.

**Root cause:** `KillContainer` (line 75) runs `podman kill` synchronously. When it returns, the container dies and `cmd.Run()` inside `runContainer` completes — but with `ctx.Err() == nil` (the context wasn't cancelled, only the container was killed externally). This causes `runContainer` to attempt parsing the partial output, which may succeed with an empty `stop_reason`. The `default` branch in the turn loop then writes `"waiting"` to the store, potentially after or before the cancel handler has already written `"cancelled"`.

**Fix:** Added the same cancelled-status guard to the `default` case (runner.go:322–325) that already existed for the error path (lines 258–263). If the task is already `"cancelled"` when the runner reaches the `default` branch, it exits cleanly without overwriting the state.

**Result**:
Now I have a clear picture. The failing task's output reveals the root cause:

```
a2a0ee2c717462feb1de2f5afd59de5fd2d8 on /workspace/wallfacer type virtiofs (rw,relatime,context=system_u:object_r:nfs_t:s0)
```

```
fatal: not a git repository (or any parent up to mount point /workspace)
Stopping at filesystem boundary (GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM not set).
```

There are two compounding issues:

**1. Git worktrees + container mounts are incompatible**

When `setupWorktrees` creates a task worktree, git places a `.git` **file** (not directory) in the worktree containing:
```
gitdir: /absolute/host/path/.git/worktrees/task-branch
```
That host-absolute path doesn't exist inside the container. So every `git` command Claude Code runs inside the container fails with "not a git repository". The code already documents this at `runner.go:475-476` and works around it with `hostStageAndCommit` — but Claude Code itself can't use git effectively. The virtiofs mount boundary makes this worse...

> 
> pls add some sort of indicator and also show the progress for the title generation.

> it should indicate number of success and fail.

**Result**:
Clean. Here's a summary of the changes:

**`handler.go`**: The `GenerateMissingTitles` handler now collects the IDs of the queued tasks and includes them as `task_ids` in the JSON response.

**`ui/js/tasks.js`**: `generateMissingTitles` now:
1. Shows a spinner immediately on click ("Checking tasks…")
2. After the API responds, starts a `setInterval` polling the global `tasks` array every second
3. Displays live progress: `⟳ X/Y generated  N ok  M failed` — the spinner stays visible while any tasks are still pending
4. The button stays disabled until all queued tasks are resolved (or the 120s timeout fires, at which point remaining ones are counted as failed)
5. On error the spinner is cleaned up and the error is shown in red

**Commit**: `86798d393375bcb9d1b6ce9e9fa16a6b3a45ddf6`

**Prompt**:

**Result**:
Now the default is defined in exactly two places — one per language boundary:

- **`runner.go`**: `defaultTaskTimeout = 15 * time.Minute` (used by all three timeout fallbacks)
- **`tasks.js`**: `DEFAULT_TASK_TIMEOUT = 15` (used by both `|| fallback` expressions and to pre-select the dropdown on form open)

To change the default in the future, update only those two constants.

> when I submit feedback.
> 
> Example task ID: b229eb6a-615c-4fc6-9a41-93a1f5978672
> 
> pls investigate and fix

**Result**:
The tests revealed a second wrinkle that the original fix missed: when `os.RemoveAll` deletes the directory, git retains a stale worktree registration in `.git/worktrees/`. The plain `git worktree add branchName path` then fails with "missing but already registered worktree". So `createWorktree` in git.go now catches that error message too and retries with `--force`, which tells git to override the stale registration.

Summary of all changes:

**`git.go`** — `createWorktree` now has a fallback when the initial `-b` add fails due to:
- `"already exists"` — branch was preserved after the directory was lost  
- `"already registered worktree"` — git's stale `.git/worktrees/` entry for the deleted dir  
Both cases retry with `git worktree add --force worktreePath branchName`.

**`runner.go`** — Before using `task.WorktreePaths`, each path is stat-checked. If any is missing, `setupWorktrees` is called to recreate them, just like a first run.

**`commit_test.go`** — Two new tests:

**Result**:
Builds cleanly. Here's a summary of the three changes made:

---

**Root cause:** `git worktree add -b task/<uuid8>` fails with "fatal: a branch named 'task/2cfcfe40' already exists" because the branch was left behind by a previous run that wasn't properly cleaned up before retry.

**Three-layer fix:**

1. **`handler.go` (primary fix)** — The retry path (`failed`/`done` → `backlog`) now calls `cleanupWorktrees` on any existing `WorktreePaths` *before* `ResetTaskForRetry` wipes them from the store. Previously, when a task failed mid-execution its worktrees were preserved for potential resume, but retrying cleared the store record without physically removing the git branch.

2. **`git.go` `createWorktree` (defensive fix)** — If `git worktree add -b` reports "already exists", it force-deletes the stale orphaned branch with `git branch -D` and retries. This handles edge cases like manual directory deletion or `pruneOrphanedWorktrees` removing the directory but leaving the branch.

**Prompt**:
> currently, failed tasks due to timeout can only be moved back to backlog.
> 
> 
> add a resume button to continue execution with extended deadline (same timeout window). also add a selector allow extend with different timeouts similar to backlog task config

**Result**:
All done. Here's a summary of the changes made:

**`store.go`** — `ResumeTask` now accepts `timeout *int`. If provided, it updates the task's timeout (clamped to 5–1440 min) before transitioning to `in_progress`.

**`handler.go`** — `ResumeTask` parses an optional `{"timeout": N}` JSON body. The body is optional (decode errors are ignored) so existing callers are unaffected. The parsed timeout is forwarded to the store.

**`ui/index.html`** — The resume section now includes a `<select id="modal-resume-timeout">` with the same timeout options as the backlog task config (5 min → 24 hours), placed inline next to the Resume button.

**`ui/js/tasks.js`** — `resumeTask()` reads the selector value and sends `{"timeout": N}` in the POST body to `/api/tasks/{id}/resume`.

**`ui/js/modal.js`** — `openModal()` pre-populates `modal-resume-timeout` with the task's current `timeout` value when the resume section is shown, so the user sees the existing deadline as a sensible default to ...

**Prompt**:
> generate missing title should only look for those that do not have a title

**Result**:
Good. The fix adds an early-return guard at the top of `GenerateTitle` (`runner.go:931-935`): if the task already has a title when the goroutine actually executes, it skips container creation entirely. This closes the race window where:

1. A task is created → `GenerateTitle` goroutine queued (title still empty)
2. User clicks "Generate Missing" before goroutine finishes → backend sees empty title, queues a second `GenerateTitle` goroutine
3. Both goroutines would previously race to write a title

With the guard, whichever goroutine runs second sees `t.Title != ""` and returns immediately without launching a container.

> 
> add changes to the .github folder. but it seems not showing in git diff? when inspect the task card details.
> 
> investigate why and fix

**Result**:
Compiles cleanly. Here's a summary of the root cause and fix:

**Root cause:** `git diff <branch>` only considers files that git is **tracking** — either committed in a branch or staged in the index. When Claude Code writes new files (like `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) using the Write/Edit tools but hasn't run `git add` on them yet, those files are **untracked**. Git silently omits them from `git diff`, so they never appear in the task card's diff view.

**Fix** (`handler.go:636-650`): After the standard tracked-file diff, we now:
1. Run `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` to enumerate all untracked files in the worktree (respecting `.gitignore`, so `node_modules/` etc. are still excluded)
2. For each untracked file, generate a diff with `git diff --no-index /dev/null <file>` — this produces a standard "new file" unified diff patch
3. Append these patches to the diff output

This covers the full range of changes: committed → staged → unstaged tracked → untracked, all now...

**Result**:
Everything looks good. Let me summarize what was implemented:

**Changes made across 3 files:**

**`ui/index.html`** — The result section is now a simple container with a dynamic list (`modal-results-list`), replacing the old fixed-ID `modal-result`/`modal-result-rendered` elements and their copy/toggle buttons.

**`ui/js/modal.js`** — Four new functions added at the top:
- `detectResultType(text)` — heuristic that flags a result as a "plan" if it contains headings matching words like plan, phase, step, design, architecture, strategy, proposal, etc.
- `renderResultsFromEvents(results)` — builds the multi-entry result list; the last (most recent) turn is always expanded, earlier turns are collapsed in `<details>` elements; heading says "Results" (plural) when there are multiple
- `copyResultEntry(entryId)` / `toggleResultEntryRaw(entryId)` — per-entry copy and raw/preview toggle

In `openModal`:
- The old single-result block is replaced with `renderResultsFromEvents([task.resu...

> I still cannot see the changes happened in this task ID: 1f83e24d-1694-4058-a1fc-32c08f23ec76. any ideas?

**Result**:
There were actually **two bugs** at play:

**Bug 1 (fixed earlier):** `git diff <branch>` silently omits untracked files. New directories like `.github/` written by Claude but not yet staged are invisible to it. Fixed by enumerating untracked files with `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` and generating individual diffs via `git diff --no-index /dev/null <file>`.

**Bug 2 (just fixed):** For completed tasks, `cleanupWorktrees` deletes the worktree directories but never clears `WorktreePaths` from the store. So `TaskDiff` on a done task still tries to run `git diff` against directories that no longer exist — git errors silently, output is empty, and you see nothing.

The fix:
- `store.go`: Added `BaseCommitHashes` field to `Task` — stores the defBranch HEAD captured just before the ff-merge
- `runner.go`: `rebaseAndMerge` now captures the base hash before each `ffMerge` and returns it; `commit()` saves it via `UpdateTaskBaseCommitHashes`
- `handler.go`: `TaskDiff` checks `os....

**Result**:
The workflow is at `/workspace/wallfacer/.github/workflows/test.yml`. It:

- Triggers on pushes and PRs to `main`
- Uses `go-version-file: go.mod` to pick up the Go version automatically
- Runs `go vet ./...` for static analysis
- Runs `go test -v -race ./...` with the race detector enabled

The tests configure their own git identity (`test@test.com` / `Test`) so no extra git setup step is needed in the workflow.

**Commit**: `de32a39e7dd33280cd8b5788d07e54d25a1fc7d2`

**Prompt**:
> if repos in the workspace is not a git repo, it seems all changes are not eventually extracted out of the sandbox, and only a PROGRESS.md appeared. 
> 
> Fix for the non-git repo usage

**Result**:
Builds clean, all tests pass. Here's a summary of what changed and why:

**Root cause**: For non-git workspaces, `setupWorktrees` simply `continue`d past them, leaving `worktreePaths` empty. The container mounted the original workspace directly via bind mount — which can be unreliable in containerized/rootless-Podman environments — and the entire commit pipeline (Phases 1–2) was skipped since it iterates `worktreePaths`. Only PROGRESS.md appeared because it's written directly by the Go server process, not through the container.

**Fix — 5 changes in `runner.go`:**

1. **`setupWorktrees`** — for non-git workspaces, instead of skipping, it calls `setupNonGitSnapshot` which: copies the workspace into `~/.wallfacer/worktrees/<uuid>/<basename>/`, runs `git init` + initial commit there. The snapshot is added to `worktreePaths` just like a git worktree, so the container mounts it from the managed directory (same reliable path as git worktrees).

2. **`setupNonGitSnapshot`** (new) �...

**Prompt**:
> Add a test to check if workspace CLAUDE.md is correctly loaded in the sandbox claude code execution

**Result**:
All done. Here's a summary of the two files changed:

**`runner.go`** — extracted `buildContainerArgs` method  
The arg-building block inside `runContainer` was pulled into a new `buildContainerArgs(containerName, prompt, sessionID string, worktreeOverrides map[string]string) []string` method. `runContainer` now calls it. Because this method is a pure function of runner config + parameters, it can be tested without launching a container.

**`instructions_test.go`** (new, 18 tests)

| Group | Tests |
|---|---|
| `instructionsKey` | stable, order-independent, different inputs → different keys, 16-char output |
| `buildInstructionsContent` | default-only when no CLAUDE.md, workspace CLAUDE.md appended with header, missing file silently skipped, multiple workspaces in order, trailing-newline padding |

**Result**:
The refactoring is complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

## Refactoring Summary

**Commit**: `0bb8095132e6c833689295d620d08938c4d1f2f2`

**Prompt**:
> "Resume previous session" seems only occur when move from cancelled to backlog.
> 
> It should exists for all other cases, except start a fresh new task which was never executed before

**Result**:
Here's a summary of all changes made:

**Root cause**: "Resume previous session" was only visible in the backlog state (card + modal edit section). The retry section for done/failed/cancelled tasks had no such option, so there was no way to express a session preference before clicking retry. Additionally, `cancelled → backlog` went through a simpler `UpdateTaskStatus` path while `done/failed → backlog` went through `ResetTaskForRetry` — now all three are unified.

**Changes:**

- **`ui/index.html`**: Added a "Resume previous session" checkbox (hidden by default) inside the retry section, below the prompt textarea.

- **`ui/js/modal.js`**: When showing the retry section, if the task has a `session_id`, reveal the checkbox and pre-check it based on `!task.fresh_start` (defaults to checked = resume).

- **`ui/js/tasks.js`** (`retryTask`): When the resume row is visible, include `fresh_start` in the PATCH body based on the checkbox state.

- **`internal/store/tasks.go`** (`ResetTaskF...

**Result**:
`internal/runner/commit_test.go` adds 9 tests covering the full `generateCommitMessage` flow:

**Prompt**:
> currently wallfacer requires a sandbox image in the setup process.

> I want to simplify this for the users:
> 
> 1. build, release, and publish the image in github using github actions
> 
> 2. let the wallfacer command line download the image from github if not available locally
> 
> 3. make sure the wallfacer env validator checks the availability of the claude code image

**Result**:
Everything looks correct. Here's a summary of all changes made:

---

**1. `.github/workflows/release.yml` (new file)**

Triggers on `v*` tags. Builds a multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) from `sandbox/Dockerfile` using Docker Buildx with GitHub Actions cache, then pushes to `ghcr.io/<owner>/wallfacer` with tags `latest`, `<major>.<minor>`, and `<version>`. Uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` — no extra secrets needed.

**2. `main.go`**

- Added `const defaultSandboxImage = "ghcr.io/changkun/wallfacer:latest"` as the single source of truth.
- `wallfacer env` now checks image availability after confirming the container runtime is present. It runs `podman images -q <image>` and reports `[ok]` if found locally, or `[!]` with the manual pull command if not.

**3. `server.go`**

- The `-image` flag now defaults to `defaultSandboxImage` instead of `wallfacer:latest`.
- Added `ensureImage(containerCmd, sandboxImage)` called at server startup: checks local image presence, and if absent, runs `...

**Result**:
The tests are now split into 6 files, each mirroring a source file:

|---|---|---|
| `helpers_test.go` | — | Shared `bg()` and `newTestStore()` helpers |
| `store_test.go` | `store.go` | `NewStore`, `loadAll`/`loadEvents` paths, `OutputsDir`, `Close`, persistence round-trips |

**Prompt**:

> 
> 1. Run `git status` to see current changes
> 2. Run `git diff` to see what will be committed

> 4. Stage all modified and new files (exclude untracked files that look unrelated)
> 5. Create a commit with a concise message describing the changes
> 
> Make git commit message is done in this way. This means the commit message generation should have access to the git history and inspect how it was done in the relevant projects

**Result**:
Here's a summary of the changes made:

**`internal/runner/commit.go`**

- `hostStageAndCommit`: added `recentLog` field to `pendingCommit`, runs `git log --oneline -3` per worktree after staging, combines logs across worktrees into `allLogs`, passes it as a new argument to `generateCommitMessage`.
- `generateCommitMessage`: signature changed from `(taskID, prompt, diffStat)` to `(taskID, prompt, diffStat, recentLog)`. When `recentLog` is non-empty, it's appended to the LLM prompt under a "Recent commits (for style reference):" section. A new rule is also added: "Match the style and tone of the recent commit history shown below".

**`internal/runner/commit_test.go`**

- All 7 direct calls to `generateCommitMessage` updated with the extra `""` argument (empty recent log, which exercises the existing paths unchanged).

**Branch**: task/5dd48a3d  
**Commit**: `a115d16a51503daef6f3cc4d033dbed75c31657d`

**Prompt**:
> waiting tasks can only be moved back to "backlog"? why is that the case? there should be a resume task implmeneted before but seems not existing for the failed/timeout tasks

**Result**:
Clean build. Here's what was changed and why:

**Root cause of the gap:**
The retry path (`→ backlog`) in `handler/tasks.go:99` only accepted `done/failed/cancelled` as source states — `waiting` was excluded. Correspondingly, `modal.js` only showed the Retry section for those same states.

**The two changes:**

1. **`handler/tasks.go`** — added `waiting` to the retry transition guard. A waiting task retried to backlog runs through the same path as a cancelled task: worktrees are cleaned up, the prompt is optionally updated, and `fresh_start` controls whether the session is preserved.

2. **`ui/js/modal.js`** — added `waiting` to the condition that shows the Retry section in the modal. This means a waiting task will now display the same retry UI (editable prompt + optional "resume session" checkbox) as failed/done/cancelled tasks.

**Re: failed tasks without a session_id** — there's nothing broken there. If a task times out before Claude returns *any* output (no session establ...

**Prompt**:
> In UI, markdown rendering for prompt seems do not render bullet point very well and "bullet dot" is missing from rendered view. Investigate and fix

**Result**:
The fix adds explicit `list-style-type` values to both `.prose-content` and `.card-prose` selectors:

- **Root cause:** Tailwind CSS preflight (loaded via CDN) resets `list-style: none` on all `ul`/`ol` elements. The prose CSS rules only set `padding-left` and `margin`, never restoring the bullet style.
- **Fix:** Split the combined `ul, ol` selector into two rules, adding `list-style-type: disc` for unordered lists and `list-style-type: decimal` for ordered lists — in both the modal (`.prose-content`) and card preview (`.card-prose`) contexts.

> focus on internal/runner package

**Result**:
Coverage target reached. Here's the final summary:

**Coverage: 35.6% → 83.1%** (target was 80%)

Three new test files were created:

- **`execute_test.go`** — `Run()` state transitions (end_turn/waiting/is_error/max_tokens/container-error), `SyncWorktrees` paths (up-to-date, behind main, non-git, dirty stash), `failSync`
- **`snapshot_test.go`** — `setupNonGitSnapshot`, `extractSnapshotToWorkspace`, non-git commit pipeline integration
- **`misc_test.go`** — Runner getters, `isConflictError`, `runGit`, `CleanupWorktrees`, `PruneOrphanedWorktrees`, `runContainer` (success/error/parse-error/context-cancel), `buildContainerArgs`, `GenerateTitle`, `writeProgressMD`, **`resolveConflicts`** (success/container-error/is_error), **`setupWorktrees` idempotent path**

The final push to 83.1% came from adding `resolveConflicts` tests (which was at 0%) and the `setupWorktrees` idempotent branch test.

**Result**:
Changed `rows="4"` to `rows="6"` on the new task textarea (`ui/index.html:108`). This adds two extra lines of height (~45px), bringing the textarea closer to the visual height of in-progress cards which include a badge header row, optional title, and up to ~4.5em of prompt text.

**Prompt**:
> in the system setting, i want to have a monitoring panel to mimic the behavior of "docker ps -a" to inspect the current running sanboxes, their container status, etc.

**Result**:
Build is clean. Here's a summary of what was added:

---

**Backend**

- `internal/runner/runner.go` — `ListContainers()` method that runs `<runtime> ps -a --filter name=wallfacer --format json`, parses the output, strips the Docker `/`-prefix from names, and extracts the task UUID from `wallfacer-<uuid>` container names. Returns a `[]ContainerInfo` slice.
- `internal/handler/containers.go` — `GetContainers` handler, calls the runner and writes JSON.
- `server.go` — Route `GET /api/containers` registered.

**Frontend**

- `ui/index.html` — New **"Sandbox Containers"** section in the settings panel with a **Monitor** button, plus a full-screen modal with a `docker ps -a`-style table (Container ID, Task, Image, State, Status, Created).
- `ui/js/containers.js` — Opens/closes the modal, fetches `/api/containers`, auto-refreshes every 5 s while open, renders the table. The **Task** column cross-references the live task list to show the task title and status badge. The **State** co...

**Prompt**:
> it looks to me the turn 1, 2, 3, ... in the waiting task details order is reversed? It would be helpful if the last turn result can be expanded than collapsed

**Result**:
The change:

- **Order fixed**: Turns are now displayed newest-first (Turn N at the top, Turn 1 at the bottom) by reversing the chronological array before rendering. Turn labels still reflect the original chronological numbering (Turn 1 = first, Turn N = most recent).
- **Last turn expanded**: The most recent turn (now at the top) is always rendered as an expanded `<div>`. Older turns render as collapsed `<details>` that can be opened on demand.

So with 3 turns you'd now see:
```
[ Turn 3 ] ← expanded, immediately visible
▶ Turn 2   ← click to expand
▶ Turn 1   ← click to expand
```

**Prompt**:
> the current kanban UI doesn't seem to support mobile mode. Update the UI styling (layout, css, etc) to support mobile mode (narrow screen)

**Result**:
All changes are in place. Here's a summary of what was done:

**`ui/index.html`**
- Replaced `grid grid-cols-5 gap-4 p-6` on `<main>` with the custom `board-grid` class (desktop grid layout is now defined in CSS, making it overridable)
- Added `id="col-wrapper-{name}"` to each of the 5 column wrapper `<div>`s
- Added a `<nav id="mobile-col-nav">` between the header and main with one pill button per column

**`ui/css/styles.css`**
- Defined `.board-grid` as a 5-column CSS grid (desktop behaviour, unchanged)
- Added `@media (max-width: 768px)` block with:
  - **Board**: switches to horizontal flex scroll with CSS scroll-snap, each column takes ~`100vw - 48px` so the next column is slightly visible as a swipe hint
  - **Mobile nav**: displayed as a scrollable pill row above the board; hidden on desktop
  - **Header**: tighter padding, workspace list capped to prevent overflow
  - **Settings panel**: bounded within viewport
  - **Modals**: bottom-sheet style (anchor to bottom, rounded top ...

**Prompt**:
> the header got bigger than before. this seems to be a regression. pls fix

**Result**:
These were both present in Tailwind's Preflight when using the CDN, but were lost when dependencies were bundled locally:

- **`body { margin: 0; }`** — Removes the browser's default 8px body margin, which was creating a visible gap above the top navigation header
- **Heading reset** — Removes the browser's default `margin-block: 0.83em` on `h2` elements; the column headers ("Backlog", "In Progress", etc.) had no explicit margin reset in `.col-header`, so they inherited ~10px top/bottom margins from the browser, making that row noticeably taller
