## Task: 5bd6c11f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 19:56:02  
**Branch**: task/5bd6c11f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> there is a bug that task card is moved to waiting although the container is still up and running and executing

**Result**:
The repository at `/workspace/wallfacer` is a git worktree whose parent `.git` directory is at `/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer` — a host macOS path that isn't accessible from inside this container. Git operations fail because the worktree's backing store doesn't exist in this environment.

The changes I made are:

**`runner.go`**
- Added `Type string \`json:"type"\`` field to `claudeOutput` to capture the event type from Claude Code's stream-json format.
- Extracted a new `parseClaudeOutput(raw string) (claudeOutput, bool, error)` function containing all NDJSON parsing logic, making it independently testable.
- Fixed the NDJSON scanning loop to scan backward and **prefer the `type:"result"` event** rather than simply taking the last parseable JSON line.
- Added propagation of `runErr` when the container produced no result event (only intermediate events) — the task is now marked **failed** instead of incorrectly transitioning to **waiting**.

## Task: 5e07080d

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:45:00  
**Branch**: task/5e07080d  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
The `/workspace/wallfacer` directory uses a **git worktree** that references a path on the original machine (`/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer`), which is not accessible in this environment. Git commands fail because the worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist here.

The change I made (`ui/index.html:29` — logo color and font-weight) is saved to disk, but I'm unable to commit it since the git repository's backing store is on a different filesystem path that isn't mounted here.

You'll need to run the commit from your local machine:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/wallfacer/worktree
git add ui/index.html
git commit -m "style: update Wallfacer logo text to bold blue (rgb(0, 85, 170))"
```

## Task: bba2460f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:51:48  
**Branch**: task/bba2460f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
There are no git repositories under `/workspace/wallfacer` — none of the directories (`ui`, `docs`, `sandbox`) or the root itself contain a `.git` folder, so there's nothing to commit.

To commit the change to `index.html`, you would need to initialize a git repo first. Would you like me to run `git init` in `/workspace/wallfacer` (or one of its subdirectories) and create the initial commit?

## Bug Fix: Commit Pipeline Broken with Git Worktrees

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Files changed**: `runner.go`, `commit_test.go` (new)

### Root Cause

The commit pipeline Phase 1 ran a **container** to ask Claude to stage and
commit changes. However, the container mounted the git **worktree** directory,
whose `.git` file contains an absolute host path like:

```
gitdir: /Users/changkun/.../wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer
```

This path does not exist inside the container. All git commands (add, commit,
status, etc.) fail silently, so Phase 1 creates no commits. Phase 2
(rebase+merge) then finds no commits ahead of the default branch and skips.
Result: **nothing gets committed, worktrees are cleaned up, changes are lost.**

Evidence from prior task results (see entries above): Claude's own output said
"the git worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist in this environment."

### Fix

Replaced Phase 1 (container-based commit via Claude) with **host-side git
operations** (`git add -A` + `git commit`) in `runner.hostStageAndCommit()`.
The host has full access to the worktree's git metadata, so the commit succeeds.

The full pipeline is now:
1. **Phase 1**: Host-side `git add -A && git commit` in each worktree
2. **Phase 2**: Host-side rebase onto default branch + ff-merge (unchanged)
3. **Phase 3**: PROGRESS.md update (unchanged)
4. **Phase 4**: Worktree cleanup (unchanged)

### Prevention

- Added 9 tests in `commit_test.go` covering the full pipeline:
  - `TestWorktreeSetup` — worktree creation
  - `TestWorktreeGitFilePointsToHost` — documents the root cause
  - `TestHostStageAndCommit` / `TestHostStageAndCommitNoChanges` — new method
  - `TestCommitPipelineBasic` — full pipeline
  - `TestCommitPipelineDivergedBranch` — rebase when main has advanced
  - `TestCommitPipelineNoChanges` — no-op when nothing changed
  - `TestCompleteTaskE2E` — exact waiting→done flow
  - `TestCommitOnTopOfLatestMain` — commits land on latest main

### Rule: Never run git inside containers on worktree mounts

Git worktrees use a `.git` **file** (not directory) that references the parent
repo's `.git/worktrees/` by absolute host path. Containers cannot resolve
these paths. All git operations on worktree data must happen on the **host**.

## Task: 08bfbaaa

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:17:58  
**Branch**: task/08bfbaaa  
**Commit**: `618f260c8999baf059ebd6fa03b2446879667177`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
Done. The "Wallfacer" logo text is now styled with `color: rgb(0, 85, 170)` and `font-weight: 700` (bold) at `index.html:29`.

## Task: 4748b65e

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:36:30  
**Branch**: task/4748b65e  
**Commit**: `91d41ab58475cefbbfbdbcfa19fd926d2e47bf7f`

**Prompt**:
> Update the current kanban UI color style to match claude's color style.
> Use https://claude.com and https://www.anthropic.com/ as examples

**Result**:
I can't see any active git diff or repository context. Could you share the diff you're referring to? It would help to know:

- Is this a diff from a PR, a git commit, or another tool?
- Which file were you expecting changes in (not `commit_test.go`)?

If you paste the diff here I can pinpoint exactly why `commit_test.go` appears in it.

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:15:25  
**Branch**: task/962182c4  
**Commit**: `2ad8c83fc7408386b447271194d191c0bacbb7e9`

**Prompt**:
> When a task card is in waiting, I want to add a capability to cancel and discard all the changes prepared. Move the card to a cancelled column instead of initiating commits and so on.
> 
> Things to consider:
> 
> 1. update relevant docs.
> 2. tasks in the backlog or in progress can also be canceled. the sandbox should also be cleaned up. 3. However, history and execution logs/traces remains to be persisted (in case future we want to restore the task back to backlog)

**Result**:
(no result recorded)

**Branch**: task/064cd76e  
**Commit**: `8c9b7f693d44b75795be5e2d2ea28e7555a6007f`

**Prompt**:
> I want to merge the waiting / failed columns into just one "waiting" column.
> 
> The tasks previously are designed to move to failed if failed should be moved to waiting. 
> 
> ACs:
> 1. UI color style should highlight it is a failed waiting.
> 2. The task card should contain more information why it was failed
> 3. The live output should include info about sandbox logs/traces
> 4. The live output should have a final response result similar to the task card in the "done" column

**Result**:
(no result recorded)

## Task: 881e4374

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:35:50  
**Branch**: task/881e4374  
**Commit**: `b703c97ffb732eb166ad073b22ad2e7a8565c6eb`

**Prompt**:
> the live log pretty rendering seems odd. Example:
> 
> ⏺ Read(/workspace/wallfacer/runner.go)
> ⎿
>    380→
>    381→	// Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
>    382→	r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
> 
> why the code there has this strange "→" symbol? this make the reading a little harder. consider to fix this

**Result**:
This regex `^(\s*\d+)→\t?` matches the line-number prefix (optional spaces + digits + arrow + optional tab) and replaces it with the number followed by two spaces. So:

- `   380→\t// comment` becomes `   380  // comment`
- `   381→` (empty line) becomes `   381  `

The output will look like:
```
   380  
   381  // Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
   382  r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
```

> 2. add a button to allow move it back to in progress and let it resolve conflicts/sync with latest changes on the original branch.

**Result**:
(no result recorded)

## Task: d33a8c2f

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:04:48  
**Branch**: task/d33a8c2f  
**Commit**: `80ea1c7b1252804a9ad34c63a45c605d7239e162`

**Prompt**:
> add project/workspace level CLAUDE.md that is initiated from the default CLAUDE.md defined in wallfacer. in the top right config center, allow manual editing to workspace level CLAUDE.md and allow re-init it by looking into individual repo folder's CLAUDE.md (if exists). The workspace level CLAUDE.md should be initialized in ~/.wallfacer/instructions folder. Allowing it to be used per unique combination of set of repo folders. E.g. Repo A and B is using wallfacer, then their workspace CLAUDE.md should be tight when both A and B are in the workspace. If not, e.g. only A, then it should be a different CLAUDE.md

**Result**:
All clean. Here's a summary of what was verified and updated in this pass:

**Code verified still clean after upstream modifications:**
- `runner.go` gained `KillContainer`, `SyncWorktrees`, `failSync`, and an enhanced `Run` with panic-recovery guard — the `instructionsPath` mount slot integrates cleanly alongside those additions.
- `handler.go` gained `CancelTask` and `SyncTask` — the three new `GetInstructions`/`UpdateInstructions`/`ReinitInstructions` handlers were already placed after those.
- `main.go` gained `/cancel` and `/sync` routes, plus a `Cancelled` column in the board — the three `/api/instructions` routes are correctly registered.
- `styles.css` gained `badge-cancelled`, `col-header-cancelled`, terminal-style `.cc-*` classes, `diff-behind-warning`, and error-in-waiting card styles — no conflicts with the instructions modal.

**`CLAUDE.md` updated to reflect current state:**
- Added `instructions.go` to the key files list.
- Updated the API routes table with the 8...

## Task: e450d712

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:09:16  
**Branch**: task/e450d712  
**Commit**: `47081030c8ec1b2e26fb8e087f0c0c166b4fbe85`

**Prompt**:
> i don't like the browser based alert "localhost Says ..." Pls implement a proper modal for those cases.

**Result**:
Done. Here's what was changed:

- **`ui/index.html`** — added an alert modal (`#alert-modal`) above the detail modal. It uses `z-[60]` so it always sits on top, and has an error icon, a message paragraph, and an OK button.
- **`ui/js/utils.js`** — added `showAlert(message)` and `closeAlert()` helper functions.
- **`ui/js/tasks.js`**, **`ui/js/git.js`**, **`ui/js/instructions.js`** — all 14 `alert()` calls replaced with `showAlert()`.
- **`ui/js/events.js`** — Escape key now closes the alert modal first (if open) before the detail modal; clicking the backdrop also closes it.

## Task: d1482f72

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:15:24  
**Branch**: task/d1482f72  
**Commit**: `e2c7da306570b96f67b5c4b0da41644a20d30ecb`

**Prompt**:
> workspace level claude.md edit doesn't seem to work. I'd expect a modal shows up a text editor (with markdown support) to allow me update the CLAUDE.md
> 
> The re-init also doesn't seem to work. it poped up a alert then gone without any UI indication.

**Result**:
Both fixes are in place. Here's a summary of what was wrong and what changed:

**Bug 1 — Edit modal closes instantly**

Root cause: clicking "Edit" called `showInstructionsEditor()` which opened the modal, but the same click event then bubbled up to the `document` click listener. That listener saw the modal was open and the click target (the Edit button) wasn't inside `.modal-card`, so it immediately called `closeInstructionsEditor()`.

Fix: `showInstructionsEditor` now accepts `event` and calls `event.stopPropagation()` at the start. The HTML `onclick` was updated to pass `event`.

**Bug 2 — Re-init from settings panel has no visible result**

Root cause: `reinitInstructions()` called `_doReinit()` without the `updateEditor` flag. The success branch for that case was empty — only errors produced feedback (`showAlert`). The user saw the `confirm()` dialog (the "alert"), clicked OK, the API call happened silently, and nothing changed visually.

Fix: when `_doReinit` succeeds witho...

## Task: 36a0245a

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:23:32  
**Branch**: task/36a0245a  
**Commit**: `18b672218c44edd2e284e9e9861a30c13386a121`

**Prompt**:
> the UI top left Wallfacer text is too boring. any claude style like fonts and color to be revised?

**Result**:
The "Wallfacer" title now uses:

- **Instrument Serif italic** — a clean editorial serif with a refined, humanist quality similar to Claude's aesthetic
- **Warm gradient** — flows from `#d97757` → `#c4623f` → `#a84e2e`, matching the existing `--accent` color palette already in the CSS (so it harmonizes with both light and dark themes)
- Dropped the blue color, uppercase transform, and wide letter-spacing in favor of a more polished, editorial feel

## Task: e767d024

**Date**: 2026-02-21 00:29:12  
**Branch**: task/e767d024  
**Commit**: `ea5c0ea83126421936f1878040216a6da9846b7a`

**Prompt**:
> the left-right side by side diff view for task card details in the waiting column seems broken. it shows only one top down and show diffs at the bottom. there is a wierd error yello box without anything inside which i expect to hide it if not error

**Result**:
Two fixes applied:

**Yellow box** (`styles.css`): The CSS `#modal-diff-behind { display: flex }` used ID-selector specificity (1,0,0), which beats Tailwind's `.hidden { display: none }` (0,1,0), so the yellow box always rendered even when empty. Fixed by splitting the rule — `display: flex` now only applies via `#modal-diff-behind:not(.hidden)`, while the base `#modal-diff-behind` rule only contains the visual/layout properties.

**Side-by-side layout** (`modal.js`): Rather than relying solely on the CSS selector `.modal-wide #modal-body { display: flex }` (which could lose to Tailwind CDN's later-injected stylesheet in the cascade), the layout is now also forced directly via `modalBody.style.display = 'flex'` inline style. Inline styles win over any CSS cascade. Cleared in both the `else` branch and `closeModal` so it doesn't bleed into non-wide modal opens.
