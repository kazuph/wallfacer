## Task: 5bd6c11f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 19:56:02  
**Branch**: task/5bd6c11f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> there is a bug that task card is moved to waiting although the container is still up and running and executing

**Result**:
The repository at `/workspace/wallfacer` is a git worktree whose parent `.git` directory is at `/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer` — a host macOS path that isn't accessible from inside this container. Git operations fail because the worktree's backing store doesn't exist in this environment.

The changes I made are:

**`runner.go`**
- Added `Type string \`json:"type"\`` field to `claudeOutput` to capture the event type from Claude Code's stream-json format.
- Extracted a new `parseClaudeOutput(raw string) (claudeOutput, bool, error)` function containing all NDJSON parsing logic, making it independently testable.
- Fixed the NDJSON scanning loop to scan backward and **prefer the `type:"result"` event** rather than simply taking the last parseable JSON line.
- Added propagation of `runErr` when the container produced no result event (only intermediate events) — the task is now marked **failed** instead of incorrectly transitioning to **waiting**.

## Task: 5e07080d

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:45:00  
**Branch**: task/5e07080d  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
The `/workspace/wallfacer` directory uses a **git worktree** that references a path on the original machine (`/Users/changkun/dev/changkun.de/wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer`), which is not accessible in this environment. Git commands fail because the worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist here.

The change I made (`ui/index.html:29` — logo color and font-weight) is saved to disk, but I'm unable to commit it since the git repository's backing store is on a different filesystem path that isn't mounted here.

You'll need to run the commit from your local machine:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/wallfacer/worktree
git add ui/index.html
git commit -m "style: update Wallfacer logo text to bold blue (rgb(0, 85, 170))"
```

## Task: bba2460f

**Date**: 2026-02-20 21:51:48  
**Branch**: task/bba2460f  
**Commit**: `(no commit)`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
There are no git repositories under `/workspace/wallfacer` — none of the directories (`ui`, `docs`, `sandbox`) or the root itself contain a `.git` folder, so there's nothing to commit.

To commit the change to `index.html`, you would need to initialize a git repo first. Would you like me to run `git init` in `/workspace/wallfacer` (or one of its subdirectories) and create the initial commit?

## Bug Fix: Commit Pipeline Broken with Git Worktrees

**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Files changed**: `runner.go`, `commit_test.go` (new)

### Root Cause

The commit pipeline Phase 1 ran a **container** to ask Claude to stage and
commit changes. However, the container mounted the git **worktree** directory,
whose `.git` file contains an absolute host path like:

```
gitdir: /Users/changkun/.../wallfacer/.git/worktrees/wallfacer
```

This path does not exist inside the container. All git commands (add, commit,
status, etc.) fail silently, so Phase 1 creates no commits. Phase 2
(rebase+merge) then finds no commits ahead of the default branch and skips.
Result: **nothing gets committed, worktrees are cleaned up, changes are lost.**

Evidence from prior task results (see entries above): Claude's own output said
"the git worktree's parent `.git` directory doesn't exist in this environment."

### Fix

Replaced Phase 1 (container-based commit via Claude) with **host-side git
operations** (`git add -A` + `git commit`) in `runner.hostStageAndCommit()`.
The host has full access to the worktree's git metadata, so the commit succeeds.

The full pipeline is now:
1. **Phase 1**: Host-side `git add -A && git commit` in each worktree
2. **Phase 2**: Host-side rebase onto default branch + ff-merge (unchanged)
3. **Phase 3**: PROGRESS.md update (unchanged)
4. **Phase 4**: Worktree cleanup (unchanged)

### Prevention

- Added 9 tests in `commit_test.go` covering the full pipeline:
  - `TestWorktreeSetup` — worktree creation
  - `TestWorktreeGitFilePointsToHost` — documents the root cause
  - `TestHostStageAndCommit` / `TestHostStageAndCommitNoChanges` — new method
  - `TestCommitPipelineBasic` — full pipeline
  - `TestCommitPipelineDivergedBranch` — rebase when main has advanced
  - `TestCommitPipelineNoChanges` — no-op when nothing changed
  - `TestCompleteTaskE2E` — exact waiting→done flow
  - `TestCommitOnTopOfLatestMain` — commits land on latest main

### Rule: Never run git inside containers on worktree mounts

Git worktrees use a `.git` **file** (not directory) that references the parent
repo's `.git/worktrees/` by absolute host path. Containers cannot resolve
these paths. All git operations on worktree data must happen on the **host**.

## Task: 08bfbaaa

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:17:58  
**Branch**: task/08bfbaaa  
**Commit**: `618f260c8999baf059ebd6fa03b2446879667177`

**Prompt**:
> The "Wallfacer" logo text on top left is black. change this to bold blue rgb(0, 85, 170)

**Result**:
Done. The "Wallfacer" logo text is now styled with `color: rgb(0, 85, 170)` and `font-weight: 700` (bold) at `index.html:29`.

## Task: 4748b65e

**Date**: 2026-02-20 22:36:30  
**Branch**: task/4748b65e  
**Commit**: `91d41ab58475cefbbfbdbcfa19fd926d2e47bf7f`

**Prompt**:
> Update the current kanban UI color style to match claude's color style.
> Use https://claude.com and https://www.anthropic.com/ as examples

**Result**:
I can't see any active git diff or repository context. Could you share the diff you're referring to? It would help to know:

- Is this a diff from a PR, a git commit, or another tool?
- Which file were you expecting changes in (not `commit_test.go`)?

If you paste the diff here I can pinpoint exactly why `commit_test.go` appears in it.

## Task: 962182c4

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:15:25  
**Branch**: task/962182c4  
**Commit**: `2ad8c83fc7408386b447271194d191c0bacbb7e9`

**Prompt**:
> When a task card is in waiting, I want to add a capability to cancel and discard all the changes prepared. Move the card to a cancelled column instead of initiating commits and so on.
> 
> Things to consider:
> 
> 1. update relevant docs.
> 2. tasks in the backlog or in progress can also be canceled. the sandbox should also be cleaned up. 3. However, history and execution logs/traces remains to be persisted (in case future we want to restore the task back to backlog)

**Result**:
(no result recorded)

## Task: 064cd76e

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:25:22  
**Branch**: task/064cd76e  
**Commit**: `8c9b7f693d44b75795be5e2d2ea28e7555a6007f`

**Prompt**:
> I want to merge the waiting / failed columns into just one "waiting" column.
> 
> The tasks previously are designed to move to failed if failed should be moved to waiting. 
> 
> ACs:
> 1. UI color style should highlight it is a failed waiting.
> 2. The task card should contain more information why it was failed
> 3. The live output should include info about sandbox logs/traces
> 4. The live output should have a final response result similar to the task card in the "done" column

**Result**:
(no result recorded)

## Task: 881e4374

**Date**: 2026-02-20 23:35:50  
**Branch**: task/881e4374  
**Commit**: `b703c97ffb732eb166ad073b22ad2e7a8565c6eb`

**Prompt**:
> the live log pretty rendering seems odd. Example:
> 
> ⏺ Read(/workspace/wallfacer/runner.go)
> ⎿
>    380→
>    381→	// Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
>    382→	r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
> 
> why the code there has this strange "→" symbol? this make the reading a little harder. consider to fix this

**Result**:
This regex `^(\s*\d+)→\t?` matches the line-number prefix (optional spaces + digits + arrow + optional tab) and replaces it with the number followed by two spaces. So:

- `   380→\t// comment` becomes `   380  // comment`
- `   381→` (empty line) becomes `   381  `

The output will look like:
```
   380  
   381  // Phase 3: persist commit hashes and write PROGRESS.md.
   382  r.store.InsertEvent(bgCtx, taskID, "output", map[string]string{
```
