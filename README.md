# Wallfacer

A Kanban task runner for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Create tasks as cards in a web UI, drag them to "In Progress" to trigger Claude Code execution in a sandbox container, and inspect results when done.

## Features

- **Kanban board** — visual task management with Backlog, In Progress, Waiting, Done, and Cancelled columns
- **Isolated sandbox execution** — each task runs in an ephemeral Docker container; tasks can run in parallel without interfering
- **Git worktree isolation** — every task gets its own git branch and worktree so concurrent changes never conflict
- **Human-in-the-loop feedback** — when Claude needs clarification, the card moves to Waiting; submit feedback to resume execution
- **Auto commit and push** — completed task changes are automatically committed and pushed to the remote
- **Live log streaming** — real-time container output via Server-Sent Events
- **Task event timeline** — full audit trail of state changes, outputs, and feedback per task
- **Usage tracking** — input/output tokens, cache hits, and cost accumulated across all turns per task
- **Workspace instructions** — per-workspace `CLAUDE.md` managed from the UI; shared across all tasks for that workspace
- **Multiple workspaces** — mount several project directories at once; Claude can read and write across all of them
- **Diff viewer** — inspect exactly what changed in each task before accepting it
- **Configurable API** — set token, base URL, and model from the UI; supports OAuth tokens, direct API keys, and any Anthropic-compatible endpoint

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.25+
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (or any Docker-compatible runtime)
- A Claude credential — either:
  - An **OAuth token** from `claude setup-token` (requires Claude Pro or Max), or
  - An **Anthropic API key** (`sk-ant-...`) from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Quick Start

**1. Obtain a credential**

```bash
# Option A — OAuth token (Claude Pro/Max)
claude setup-token   # prints the token; copy it

# Option B — API key
# Generate one at console.anthropic.com → API Keys
```

**2. Configure the environment file**

`wallfacer run` creates `~/.wallfacer/.env` automatically on first launch. Edit it and fill in your credential:

```bash
# Option A — OAuth token
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=<your-token>

# Option B — API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Optional — custom endpoint (proxy, alternative provider, etc.)
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com

# Optional — pin a specific model
# CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5
```

You can also edit all of these from **Settings → API Configuration** in the web UI without restarting the server.

**3. Build the sandbox image**

```bash
make build
```

**4. Build and start the server**

```bash
go build -o wallfacer .
wallfacer run ~/projects/myapp ~/projects/mylib
```

The browser opens automatically to http://localhost:8080.

## Usage

```bash
# Mount specific workspace directories
wallfacer run ~/project1 ~/project2

# Defaults to current directory if no args given
wallfacer run

# Custom port, skip auto-opening the browser
wallfacer run -addr :9090 -no-browser ~/myapp

# Show configuration and env file status
wallfacer env

# All flags
wallfacer run -help
```

### How It Works

1. Create a task card in the Backlog column with a prompt for Claude
2. Drag it to In Progress — Wallfacer launches a sandbox container and runs Claude Code
3. When Claude finishes, the card moves to Done and changes are committed to your repo
4. If Claude asks a question, the card moves to Waiting — submit feedback to continue

See [Task Lifecycle](docs/task-lifecycle.md) for details on all states and transitions.

### Make Targets

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `make build` | Build the sandbox image |
| `make server` | Build and run the Go server |
| `make run PROMPT="..."` | Headless one-shot Claude execution |
| `make shell` | Debug shell inside a sandbox container |
| `make clean` | Remove the sandbox image |

## Origin Story

Wallfacer was built in about a week of spare time. The idea came from using Claude Code for everyday coding tasks. After a while, the workflow settled into writing task descriptions, running Claude, reviewing the output, and repeating. The main bottleneck was watching Claude Code's execution and managing all these tasks, so a Kanban board felt like a natural fit for managing that loop.

The first version was a Go server with a simple web UI. Tasks go into a backlog, get dragged to "in progress" to run Claude Code in a container, and move to "done" when finished. Git worktrees keep each task isolated so multiple can run at the same time without stepping on each other.

At some point Wallfacer was stable enough to develop itself and can create a task card like "add retry logic," drag it to in progress, and let Claude implement the feature inside a Wallfacer sandbox. Most of the later features were built this way.
